# Direct Contact Sorptive Extraction data analysis

This is old code for analysis and figures related to:
Kfoury, N., Scott, E., Orians, C. & Robbat, A. (2017) Direct Contact Sorptive Extraction: A Robust Method for Sampling Plant Volatiles in the Field. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 65, 8501â€“8509.

This is old stuff, before I knew how to organize a research compendium and knew how to use GitHub.  I'm not going to bother to organize it now because it's already published.
